# Multimodal Data Integration and Analysis

This repository contains the code and data used for the research paper submitted to NeurIPS 2024. The project focuses on integrating and analyzing multimodal data using advanced machine learning techniques, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models.

## Project Overview

This project integrates various types of data:
- **Social Media Data**: Number of posts, likes, comments, and shares.
- **Wearable Data**: Steps taken, hours of sleep, heart rate, and calories burned.
- **Academic Data**: GPA, attendance, and number of extracurricular activities.
- **Peer Interaction Data**: Number of friends, messages sent, and group activities participated.

The goal is to use these diverse datasets to build a model that can predict early signs of mental health disorders by leveraging the strengths of different machine learning models.

## Dependencies

The required dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using pip install -r requirements.txt

To run the script, run python main.py in the terminal.
